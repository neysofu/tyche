# Tyche ![build](https://travis-ci.org/neysofu/tyche.svg?branch=master) ![scala version](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-2.12.0-blue.svg)
Tyche is a small and robust statistical library for the JVM. Many JVM-hosted numerical libraries offer similar functionalities, but they seem to be unnecessarily bloated and they fail to provide straightforward APIs. Instead, Tyche is built from the ground up in accordance to good design principles.

Tyche is tiny and yet badass. Here's why:

- Discrete & Continuous distributions.
- Foolproof analysis tools.
- Efficient numerical manipulation techniques.
- The coolest Markov chains you'll ever see.
- Fully modular design.
- Simple Random Sampling (SRS) support.
- **Extensive** documentation!
- Enviable test coverage.

The library is written in Scala 2.12.0 and was tested last with sbt 0.13.13.

## Setup
Tyche is published to *Maven Central*, so you just need to paste this line in you build configuration file:

	libraryDependencies += "io.neysofu" %% "tyche" % "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT" // Or whatever release version you want
